## üñ•Ô∏è CAD Design (Fusion 360)

Each link of the robotic arm is modeled as a separate component in **Autodesk Fusion 360**, allowing for:
- Individual assembly and modification
- Motion constraints using revolute joints
- Export as `.STL` for 3D printing

Dimensions used:
- Base: 10x10x2 cm  
- Link 1: 3x3x15 cm  
- Link 2: 3x3x25 cm  
- Link 3: 3x3x20 cm  
- Wrist Links: 3x3x5 cm  
- End Effector: 4 cm dia x 5 cm height

## üîå Circuit Design

An Arduino Uno controls six servo motors and an ultrasonic sensor. Power is supplied externally for stable motor operation.

### Pin Mapping:
- Servo 1 to 6 ‚Üí D2 to D7  
- HC-SR04 Trigger ‚Üí D8  
- HC-SR04 Echo ‚Üí D9  
- External 5V ‚Üí Servo VCC  
- GND shared between Arduino and servos

## üß† Arduino Code

The Arduino sketch controls each servo using the `Servo.h` library. Basic movements and scanning logic with the ultrasonic sensor can be added.

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>
Servo s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6;

void setup() {
  s1.attach(2); s2.attach(3); s3.attach(4);
  s4.attach(5); s5.attach(6); s6.attach(7);
}

void loop() {
  s1.write(90); s2.write(45); s3.write(135);
  s4.write(90); s5.write(90); s6.write(90);
  delay(1000);
}
